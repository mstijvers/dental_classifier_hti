NOTE! everyone has to add the Dentaldata folder manually to her directory. See attached images for the location. Moreover, when you want the code to run, ensure to run the app.py file. Then open the link provided in the terminal: http://127.0.0.1:5000.
The index.html file doesn't start te server and hence will not work.
